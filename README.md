Multiple Pi Zero security system for a home
This describes building a multiple-camera security system with IR motion detection, temperature monitoring, and liquid warnings in case of heating/cooling system failure or flooding due to pipe breakage or weather. It uses three Raspberry Pi Model Zero Ws. Two have remotely viewable cameras to monitor the doors of the house. One has IR-based motion detection and e-mails notification of motion to multiple addresses. The Rpi_Cam_Web_Interface project provides live camera feeds on the internet, protected by passwords, and enables control of the motion detection software. Rapid light changes due to clouds ruled out using just the camera motion detection to send alarms, so a strategically placed motion detection unit (PIR) was used for motion detection. A temperature/humidity sensor (DHT22) monitors the temperature hourly and sends e-mail alarms if it is too hot or too cold. A separate Zero W with a dampness sensor in the basement will just send an e-mail if liquid is detected and upon startup. It is possible to add additional cameras if desired, just increase the quantity of camera kits, SD cards and power supplies as needed. Finally, Dataplicity is used to allow remote maintenance of the system.

updated to move some pins to make hookup easier with connectors.
